# studyforgoogle

👋🏼 Hiii!

You probably got the hint on what I'm studying for, its true I started to prep for Google.✨

Will I succeed in getting hired? I dont know but you bet Im studying my butt so I can say 
this opportunity wasnt wasted.

I will be doing all sorts of algorithm problems and this is mainly for me but if you found
this helpful go ahead and I hope I helped.

The way I am organizing it is so that I have it available on one single repo 
so I will not have seperate files for each problem, but instead all problems in a series

I like to go back and forth and this way its easier for me to revert back to a certain solution 
to help me solve the current one I am on .
