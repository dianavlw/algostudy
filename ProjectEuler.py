Factors and Multiples:

Factor aka divisor of a number even divides it:
10 is a factor of 20
20 // 10 = 2

3 is a factor of 12 
12 / 3 == 4

Multiple of a number n is any integer times n:
20 is a multiple of 10
10 * 2 = 20
12 is a multple of 3
3 * 4 = 12

Problem 1.

Multiples of 3 and 5.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

solve by using a for loop

for i in range(1, 1000)
    if i % 3 == 0 pr i % 5 == 0:
         sum += 1
print(sum)
